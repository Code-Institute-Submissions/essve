### Product management Tool for ESSVE

Welcome to my Product management Tool for ESSVE,
To provide easy navigation and access to products that isn't for sale, I've created this Tool.
It's like an e-commerce without the buying functionality.

## UX

I've created this website so that the staff of ESSVE can locate products and the product information, in an easy matter. This regards only products for internal usage, like interior, give-aways, brochures, etc.

*It has an easy navigational layout with a reacurring structure for easy use.
*It presents the products devided into categories, in a easy to understand and overview manner.
*It will have filtering functions and search-functions. allthough these isn't finished yet.
*It will also be possible to create "shopping-lists" from here and generate a excel or pdf to use when placing an order.

I have been working at ESSVE for almost 7 years as a customer service representative and it has always been a struggle to locate this type of products for us and our sales staff.
It was clear to me that this is what I had to create once I got some knowledge of JavaScript.

I started of making a list of all the futures that I needed, Which now is included although not all done.

It was clear to me how the layout would look so I skipped over the wireframe-part, also concidering I needed to convince noone this was a good idea.

I have focused on the overall functionallity before the layout so have indulgence, this is a (for me) huge and ongoing project.

## Features

### Existing Features:
* A login page so only those who should have access is the only ones that gets access. Managed by PHP and MySQL.
* Category filtering based on properties of the product. Managed by JavaScript.

### Future Features to be included:
* A searchbar to search for products.
* Product filters.
* A nice profile page from where one can manage change of personal information.
* The ability to create a shopping list by adding products from the site or product pages.
* I'm hoping to be able to add the possability to generate product shelf labels as well.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
* JSONBin.io
* MySQL
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - for easy creating the overall layout and functions.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - for inclusion of icons.
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) - to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

I run my projects simultaneously as I write the code. This way I can make sure everything does what I expect it to do.
I can do my tweaks and test them in realtime, as I write the code.

When all is finished, I try out each function and subdomain individually. To make sure everything works as expected.

During the initial testing there is always some minor issues that needs to be approached. For example I noticed that the header didn't shrink enough when the page was viewed on small screen devices so this was something I had to approach. Which has been corrected now.
I also noticed that some styles I had previously added to some subtitles has not been displaying correctly but has also been fixed.
At this stage hopefully all issues has been approached and solved.

All testing is done manually by me, and I'm picky, so rest a sure I'll always do anything in my power to deliver a properlly working site.
All testing is done sequential, and structured. Like when testing forms;

1. I fill out the forms as one should and submit.
2. I then check to see if everything ended up where it's supposed to go.
3. I then check the error logs.
4. I do this again but with failing details, like a non-working mailaddress. To see what happens and if anything can be done differntly.

Lastly I always run a validator tool to validate the CSS and the HTML, to see that there aren't any obvious mistakes left.

## Deployment

I'm not sure on what information I should provide here concidering I've only regulary commited and pushed my work to GitHub, and thereafter,
in the settings, deployed it as a Github page. As I usually do at this time.
